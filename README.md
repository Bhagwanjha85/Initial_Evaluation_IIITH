This project is a **React-based web application** designed to provide a **user-friendly 
interface** to demonstrate the **Forced Alignment** process.

## **What is Forced Adjustment?**

**Forced Alignment** is the process of automatically synchronizing an **audio file** with its **text output**.  
It determines when **each word and sound (sound unit)** begins and ends during speech.


## **How to use**

1. Click **"Upload WAV files"** or **drag and drop the audio files to the upload area**.  
2. **Enter the transcription for each file** (for example: `"Hello World"`).  
3. **Click "Run Alignment"** to start the alignment process.  
4. **See results** shown in tables showing **words** and **sounds** times.  
5. **Download output:**  
   - **TextGrid File** - for use in tools such as *Pratt*.  
   - **Report File** - A `.txt` summary of all alignment data.
